### Dynamics and Trends in General and Technological High Schools (2020-2021)

Using open data, we're going to prepare several graphs to illustrate a number of issues. The first is how many pupils will we have in secondary school in 2020, by academy?

In our top 5, we can see that Versailles is in first place with 56,887 students in seconde, followed by Créteil with 41,697 students, Lille with 33,935 students, Nantes with 31,023 students and Lyon with 29,457 students. To get a better idea, we'll create a histogram illustrating our Top Three academies with the most students in secondary school in 2020. The distinction between Versailles, Créteil and Lille is clear. Versailles remains in first place, with the highest number of students in secondary education in 2020.

 Another question we explored concerned the distribution of 2nde GT students according to the LV1 chosen at the start of the 2021 school year. According to our results, English is the most common language chosen as LV1, with over 550,000 students in 2nde Générale et Technologique. In second place, over 11,000 students in 2nde study German, while 4,499 opt for Spanish. Finally, in last place, we have over 2,000 students studying languages other than those mentioned.
This choice of LV1 can be explained by strong globalization, as having English as LV1 can be very useful, given that it is one of the most widely used languages. As for German, we can only assume that this is due to our close proximity to Germany in Alsace. Being a language widely spoken in the region, it's plausible to assume that there's a link between the choice of German as LV1.

The final question concerns the académies that recorded an increase in pupil numbers between the start of the 2020 school year and the start of the 2021 school year. Versailles, Créteil and Lyon once again feature in the top three académies accumulating the most pupils between 2020 and 2021. Versailles, Créteil and Lyon once again feature in the top three académies accumulating the most students between 2020 and 2021.

Let's take a closer look at the variations in enrolment gains between each academy, and the disparities between genders. Is there a numerical predominance of girls or boys in these variations?
We find that among the three best academies in terms of student recruitment for the 2020-2021 school year and the 2019-2020 school year, there is a predominance of the number of girls over boys.

We note that among the top three academies in terms of student recruitment for the 2020-2021 school year and the 2019-2020 school year, there is a predominance of the number of girls over boys.
